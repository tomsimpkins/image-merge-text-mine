30/07/2017, 23:15 - Tom Simpkins: I've realised they've justified everything by feeling and not rationale
30/07/2017, 23:27 - Jess Edwards: Email:
30/07/2017, 23:37 - Jess Edwards: Hi Mum, 

Thank you for your message, I appreciate it. I do understand that you and Dad are private people, but I also think that my request was reasonable.

When we spoke earlier, I found it difficult to have a discussion as I didn't feel like my points were taken on board. 

If I was younger, I would understand the concerns for the house. However, I am 25 and the people staying wouldn't be strangers - they'd be a few of my closest friends. I have never given you reason to worry about my maturity before, and would of course treat the house respectfully.

In regards to asking the question in front of George, he is old enough to know not to take advantage. 

The request was for a few friends (Loz and the two robs) to keep me company in the house for a couple of nights. We would be out on our bikes all day, and could even eat out in the evening if that would help. 

Tom x

31/07/2017, 00:05 - Tom Simpkins: So instead of parents saying your also great George, you and Tom are different people
31/07/2017, 00:05 - Tom Simpkins: Etc
31/07/2017, 00:05 - Tom Simpkins: They now just ensure George and I are treated completely equally
31/07/2017, 00:06 - Jess Edwards: Which is silly

31/07/2017, 14:35 - Jess Edwards: Mum thinks sue may be scared of Kevin hence email just to you? Though I feel she may be projecting her own relationship with Gary onto the situation...

31/07/2017, 14:38 - Tom Simpkins: I'm having a bike holiday
31/07/2017, 14:39 - Tom Simpkins: And if they find out I can say "it was a feeling I can't really describe"
31/07/2017, 14:39 - Jess Edwards: Well done for sending snook
31/07/2017, 14:39 - Tom Simpkins: As my justification

31/07/2017, 14:39 - Tom Simpkins: Haha yay
31/07/2017, 14:40 - Tom Simpkins: I refrained from using: can I ask that you stop feeling and start thinking
31/07/2017, 14:40 - Jess Edwards: Yes good refrain!
31/07/2017, 14:41 - Tom Simpkins: I would have put quotes around feeling and thinking

21/08/2017, 12:36 - Jess Edwards: Saw the most lovely doctor. She asked me questions and said she things the pain I've had is a combination of coming off the progesterone only pill after 4 years combined with the coil. She things the pain from last few days has been more coming off the pill related, and checked that the coil is in place and it was. Appaz when you come off the progesterone only pill, you often get bad pains because you start ovulating again. She said give it 3 months to settle, and if it still hurts after than then have it removed.
21/08/2017, 12:36 - Tom Simpkins: Wow three months is a long time

12/10/2017, 09:37 - Tom Simpkins: I'm wearing jumper
12/10/2017, 09:38 - Tom Simpkins: Rob Stabler inviting me to cape town in March:
12/10/2017, 09:38 - Tom Simpkins: hey mate - random one but basically what would you think about going to cape town in march?
Was originally thinking about going back and doing the bike ride around the cape (literally so stunning) as a medics trip but everyone has slowly bailed so currently just me and 2 of the medic girls interested, so I was planning on bailing too but I thought I would see if any of you boys wanted to go to CT first? Spoke to Rich earlier and he said he couldn't afford it and Max is already going to CT like 2 weeks later so would only be able to overlap briefly.... but if you are keen I will ask others too (I haven't asked on group thread because I think likely to end up just Wadsworth and me and not sure I would go in that situation...)
Obvs no pressure if you're not keen I'll just sack it off - but if it does sound good to you then it could be a fun trip :)
The bike ride is 11th March so I would probably go like 5th-18th if I go... 
And obvs if you are keen see if Jess / anyone else you would want to bring wants to join :)...
12/10/2017, 09:39 - Tom Simpkins: I think too much cost given 'nam saving
12/10/2017, 09:39 - Jess Edwards: Aw, that is such a lovely offer, and if we weren't planning 'nam I would have said absolutely yes!
12/10/2017, 09:39 - Jess Edwards: If you would like to go, I understand
12/10/2017, 09:39 - Jess Edwards: Maybe push skiing?
12/10/2017, 09:40 - Jess Edwards: For reference, V will probs cost around 800
12/10/2017, 09:40 - Jess Edwards: So you can work out ❤❤❤
12/10/2017, 09:41 - Tom Simpkins: I would prefer to do cycle over ski because the value per pound is much greater
12/10/2017, 09:41 - Jess Edwards: Bearing in mind I was also considering an America trip I don't think I can afford both
12/10/2017, 09:42 - Jess Edwards: I don't want it to impact your enthusiasm for Vietnam
12/10/2017, 09:42 - Jess Edwards: But if it won't, then that's totes cool

12/10/2017, 09:51 - Jess Edwards: I worry that the medic girls would bait you
12/10/2017, 09:52 - Jess Edwards: However don't think clever for me to come as won't keep up and have committed to Nam and perhaps seeing Katelyn in Montana

20/10/2017, 07:38 - Tom Simpkins: http://www.bbc.com/news/education-41664459
20/10/2017, 07:38 - Tom Simpkins: Good idea
20/10/2017, 07:39 - Tom Simpkins: This article is outrageously misleading
20/10/2017, 07:40 - Tom Simpkins: The stats say nothing of success rate of application
20/10/2017, 07:40 - Tom Simpkins: If applications from the North of England are significantly fewer
20/10/2017, 07:41 - Tom Simpkins: There could be same acceptance rate
20/10/2017, 07:41 - Tom Simpkins: Also need to look at A level results between the region's
20/10/2017, 07:46 - Jess Edwards: Urgh
20/10/2017, 07:46 - Jess Edwards: Oxford comms team have a job on their hands
20/10/2017, 07:46 - Jess Edwards: That's so unfair
20/10/2017, 07:46 - Tom Simpkins: Ikr
20/10/2017, 07:47 - Jess Edwards: Oxford's statement is really good
20/10/2017, 07:48 - Jess Edwards: it says nothing about acceptance rates, and the headline just reinforces such negative stereotypes that will dissuade students from applying
20/10/2017, 07:49 - Tom Simpkins: Exactly
20/10/2017, 07:50 - Tom Simpkins: Though I do think sending a letter to straight a student is a decent idea
20/10/2017, 07:50 - Tom Simpkins: Like, get straight A's at AS and get a letter
20/10/2017, 07:51 - Tom Simpkins: That was basically what happened when a teacher at my school pushed me to apply
20/10/2017, 07:51 - Tom Simpkins: If he hadn't then I wouldn't have done
20/10/2017, 08:00 - Jess Edwards: Yes I agree Bon idea

20/10/2017, 09:48 - Tom Simpkins: They're in Northampton
20/10/2017, 09:49 - Tom Simpkins: If they drive directly to ours
20/10/2017, 09:49 - Tom Simpkins: Then they'll arrive at 1210
20/10/2017, 09:49 - Tom Simpkins: Except they have to do 11 deliveries in that period
20/10/2017, 09:50 - Tom Simpkins: The upper bound of delivery slot is 1245
20/10/2017, 09:50 - Tom Simpkins: LOL

29/10/2017, 10:10 - Tom Simpkins: There is a cheaper option which doesn't beam out WiFi, so we'll be swapping a cable around every time we use a different computer
29/10/2017, 10:11 - Tom Simpkins: That'll be 20 pounds I think
29/10/2017, 10:11 - Tom Simpkins: I'm pro the former

09/12/2017, 18:17 - Tom Simpkins: How did he say no?
09/12/2017, 18:18 - Jess Edwards: I didn't even say how much they are, I said a contribution towards flights to Montana
09/12/2017, 18:18 - Jess Edwards: And he said that's not a present that's money
09/12/2017, 18:18 - Jess Edwards: And I said, well it would mean I could go to Montana
09/12/2017, 18:18 - Jess Edwards: And he said 'no, that's not a present'
09/12/2017, 18:18 - Jess Edwards: 'What else do you want'
09/12/2017, 18:19 - Jess Edwards: And I said 'that's the only thing, really'
09/12/2017, 18:19 - Jess Edwards: And then he kicked off
09/12/2017, 18:19 - Jess Edwards: And I was too exhausted to fight about the reason he said no to 'a contribution'
09/12/2017, 18:19 - Jess Edwards: I'm not giving him anything else
09/12/2017, 18:20 - Jess Edwards: I literally don't have anything else I want
09/12/2017, 18:22 - Tom Simpkins: So annoying, you know that this is because he's carrying the tension from last night

09/12/2017, 18:30 - Jess Edwards: He might be reasonable
09/12/2017, 18:31 - Jess Edwards: If not I'll ask Katelyn how much it would be if her mum is paying for car rental
09/12/2017, 18:31 - Jess Edwards: He's just doing it to make a point
09/12/2017, 18:32 - Jess Edwards: I'm so annoyed

15/12/2017, 17:50 - Jess Edwards: I didn't find it helpful
15/12/2017, 17:50 - Jess Edwards: And she wasn't very understanding
15/12/2017, 17:50 - Jess Edwards: After previously being super understanding
15/12/2017, 17:50 - Jess Edwards: So felt really thrown
15/12/2017, 17:52 - Jess Edwards: Maybe also English not being first language means she phrases some things weirdly

18/01/2018, 09:09 - Jess Edwards: There are loads of headlines saying that gender pay gap figures are stumping staticians because they can't all be linked to proportion of women at top etc. Has it not occurred to people that it's institutionalised discrimination against women in general???
18/01/2018, 09:40 - Tom Simpkins: My guess is statisticians are finding it difficult because it's hard to quantify discrimination numerically
18/01/2018, 09:40 - Tom Simpkins: They're all about numbers

18/01/2018, 12:18 - Tom Simpkins: Mention what

18/01/2018, 12:19 - Jess Edwards: And subtly communicate my doubts?

18/01/2018, 12:19 - Jess Edwards: Only risk is that holly mentions me and makes out like we're bezzies
18/01/2018, 12:19 - Jess Edwards: But then I suppose they'll ask what I think?
18/01/2018, 12:20 - Tom Simpkins: Then you have to be completely honest
18/01/2018, 12:20 - Tom Simpkins: I think preemptively saying anything negative is bad
18/01/2018, 12:20 - Jess Edwards: So I will wait and not mention

22/02/2018, 13:10 - Jess Edwards: You know the big Foyles book shop near Charing Cross? Could we go there? It has a cafe and I need some new books!
22/02/2018, 13:15 - Jess Edwards: Gonna run in morn

22/02/2018, 13:18 - Tom Simpkins: Yep
22/02/2018, 14:11 - Tom Simpkins: Tempted by economist subscription
22/02/2018, 14:46 - Jess Edwards: Would you read? If so, do it!
22/02/2018, 14:46 - Jess Edwards: Also apparently 2 bed flags in battersea are around 375,000
22/02/2018, 14:46 - Jess Edwards: Northern line set to extend there by 2020
22/02/2018, 14:46 - Tom Simpkins: Cool!!
22/02/2018, 14:46 - Jess Edwards: One to keep on our radar
22/02/2018, 14:53 - Jess Edwards: Average London council tax bill is 1300 a year, while Wandsworth is 686!
22/02/2018, 15:35 - Jess Edwards: Maw maw maw
22/02/2018, 15:35 - Jess Edwards: How u
22/02/2018, 16:45 - Jess Edwards: Lol I just nearly died choking from a random sip of water at my desk
22/02/2018, 16:50 - Tom Simpkins: You okay???????
22/02/2018, 16:50 - Tom Simpkins: Maw
22/02/2018, 18:01 - Jess Edwards: Juliana has completely stabbed me in the back and given awful feedback about my writing
22/02/2018, 18:01 - Jess Edwards: Which is so unfair!
22/02/2018, 18:01 - Tom Simpkins: Urgh
22/02/2018, 18:01 - Tom Simpkins: So unfair
22/02/2018, 18:02 - Jess Edwards: But now Alisa has it down as an area for development and wants to do my 6 month review as late as possible in March so she doesn't have to flag it to senior management as an area of concern
22/02/2018, 18:02 - Jess Edwards: I'm really upset
22/02/2018, 18:02 - Tom Simpkins: Urgh
22/02/2018, 18:02 - Jess Edwards: I have to be proactive in seeming to address it
22/02/2018, 18:02 - Jess Edwards: But for fuck's sake
22/02/2018, 18:02 - Tom Simpkins: Ffs
22/02/2018, 18:02 - Jess Edwards: I'm so angry with Juliana
22/02/2018, 18:02 - Tom Simpkins: Absolutely horrid
22/02/2018, 18:03 - Jess Edwards: She said if there's an area for concern there is always the possibility that the probation is extended!!!!!
22/02/2018, 18:03 - Jess Edwards: But said there's no chance I won't pass it.
22/02/2018, 18:03 - Jess Edwards: But she wants to avoid extending it
22/02/2018, 18:03 - Tom Simpkins: How bad was the feedback?
22/02/2018, 18:03 - Jess Edwards: I'm really upset
22/02/2018, 18:03 - Jess Edwards: Must have been bad for this
22/02/2018, 18:03 - Tom Simpkins: You don't get too see it?
22/02/2018, 18:08 - Jess Edwards: Not yet
22/02/2018, 18:08 - Jess Edwards: I mean I think it was verbal and she gave examples like draft things I worked on
22/02/2018, 18:09 - Jess Edwards: I'm really upset
22/02/2018, 18:09 - Jess Edwards: All my other feedback has been so good
22/02/2018, 18:09 - Tom Simpkins: I think it's really sketchy that you don't get to see
22/02/2018, 18:09 - Jess Edwards: Imagine if I didn't pass probation
22/02/2018, 18:09 - Jess Edwards: I mean she reeled off a few examples
22/02/2018, 18:09 - Jess Edwards: And then I got back to my desk and a client had pulled me up on some typos and scar had told me off
22/02/2018, 18:09 - Jess Edwards: Which is my bad
22/02/2018, 18:10 - Jess Edwards: But just feel on verge of tears and what if I don't pass probation and this just undermines all my great feedback and hard work
22/02/2018, 18:10 - Tom Simpkins: And I would put good money on anyone who reads feedback to see that's anomaly
22/02/2018, 18:10 - Tom Simpkins: You'll pass your probation
22/02/2018, 18:10 - Tom Simpkins: Juliana is gone
22/02/2018, 18:10 - Tom Simpkins: Anyone else will say your writing is great
22/02/2018, 18:15 - Tom Simpkins: Love you
22/02/2018, 18:15 - Jess Edwards: The typos have just cemented the problem in my mind
22/02/2018, 18:15 - Jess Edwards: It's never anything I've encountered before
22/02/2018, 18:16 - Jess Edwards: Maybe I'm complacent
22/02/2018, 18:16 - Tom Simpkins: You're good at writing
22/02/2018, 18:16 - Tom Simpkins: Don't let an arsey director let you think otherwise
22/02/2018, 18:16 - Jess Edwards: I know
22/02/2018, 18:17 - Tom Simpkins: Juliana disagrees for the sake of it
22/02/2018, 18:17 - Tom Simpkins: And feels the need to stay in touch
22/02/2018, 18:17 - Jess Edwards: It's just bad projects that Juliana over reviewed and decided to take it out on me
22/02/2018, 18:17 - Tom Simpkins: Indeed
22/02/2018, 18:17 - Tom Simpkins: Everyone else has avoided or left the edreams account
22/02/2018, 18:17 - Tom Simpkins: It's got a reputation
22/02/2018, 18:17 - Jess Edwards: I know
22/02/2018, 18:18 - Jess Edwards: But what if it makes me delay probation
22/02/2018, 18:18 - Jess Edwards: I'm so scared about that
22/02/2018, 18:18 - Tom Simpkins: That'd be shit
22/02/2018, 18:18 - Jess Edwards: Or not pass
22/02/2018, 18:18 - Jess Edwards: I mean how embarrassing
22/02/2018, 18:18 - Tom Simpkins: But you could definitely appeal
22/02/2018, 18:18 - Jess Edwards: Yeah but once that ruling made
22/02/2018, 18:18 - Tom Simpkins: If Alisa doesn't want to extend then you can ask for feedback from others on your writing
22/02/2018, 18:19 - Tom Simpkins: Her backing important
22/02/2018, 18:19 - Jess Edwards: I asked Alisa and she said there is zero chance of me not passing
22/02/2018, 18:25 - Tom Simpkins: That good
22/02/2018, 18:25 - Jess Edwards: Yeah
22/02/2018, 18:26 - Jess Edwards: I think she may have been delivering in an overly formal way
22/02/2018, 18:26 - Jess Edwards: Still though - Juliana made a really big deal of it so now I feel like people's backs are up and aware of it as a potential weakness.
22/02/2018, 18:27 - Jess Edwards: Just quite upset
22/02/2018, 18:50 - Tom Simpkins: Understandably
22/02/2018, 18:50 - Tom Simpkins: But take comfort from the context of the review as much as you can
22/02/2018, 18:51 - Tom Simpkins: Backs up on other parties is fine as your writing is good!
22/02/2018, 19:00 - Jess Edwards: Haha yes silver lining
22/02/2018, 19:00 - Jess Edwards: Just the first time I've got negative feedback in a really long time
22/02/2018, 19:00 - Jess Edwards: Especially in an area I am confident in
22/02/2018, 19:00 - Jess Edwards: Makes me feel deluded
22/02/2018, 19:00 - Jess Edwards: I suppose at least I know I can improve
22/02/2018, 19:00 - Jess Edwards: Thanks snook
22/02/2018, 19:02 - Jess Edwards: Just hit by absolute fear I won't pass probation
22/02/2018, 19:03 - Jess Edwards: Though Alisa said that won't happen
22/02/2018, 19:03 - Tom Simpkins: But no chance of that
22/02/2018, 19:03 - Jess Edwards: Yeah.
22/02/2018, 19:03 - Jess Edwards: I was just doing so well
22/02/2018, 19:03 - Tom Simpkins: You still are
22/02/2018, 19:03 - Jess Edwards: And now I have to go skiing while waiting for review
22/02/2018, 19:03 - Tom Simpkins: I understand
22/02/2018, 19:03 - Jess Edwards: I hope I am
22/02/2018, 19:03 - Tom Simpkins: It's like some one said I bad at maths
22/02/2018, 19:03 - Jess Edwards: I would die of shame if I didn't pass probation
22/02/2018, 19:03 - Jess Edwards: Yeah.
22/02/2018, 19:03 - Jess Edwards: I'm so annoyed
22/02/2018, 19:04 - Jess Edwards: And to improve I'm getting specific writing training
22/02/2018, 19:04 - Tom Simpkins: You've got a degree and every other person ever to tell you otherwise
22/02/2018, 19:04 - Tom Simpkins: Lol
22/02/2018, 19:04 - Jess Edwards: Which is frankly a waste of everyone's time
22/02/2018, 19:04 - Tom Simpkins: By whom
22/02/2018, 19:04 - Jess Edwards: Unsure
22/02/2018, 19:04 - Jess Edwards: And I had to flag it to scar and a woman called Alice on McD as an area of development so they can help
22/02/2018, 19:05 - Tom Simpkins: Sounds like a bad process
22/02/2018, 19:05 - Tom Simpkins: That you had to flag I mean
22/02/2018, 19:05 - Tom Simpkins: How grim
22/02/2018, 19:05 - Jess Edwards: It's so everyone can 'help' me.
22/02/2018, 19:05 - Tom Simpkins: Grim
22/02/2018, 19:06 - Tom Simpkins: Well carry on being awesome and hopefully it'll make Juliana look bad
22/02/2018, 19:22 - Jess Edwards: Spoke to twiggy on phone
22/02/2018, 19:22 - Jess Edwards: Feel bit better
22/02/2018, 19:22 - Jess Edwards: ❤❤❤❤

22/02/2018, 22:09 - Jess Edwards: Hmmmmm
22/02/2018, 22:09 - Jess Edwards: I don't my baban

22/02/2018, 22:10 - Jess Edwards: Delish
22/02/2018, 22:11 - Jess Edwards: We should come here
22/02/2018, 22:13 - Tom Simpkins: Indeed
23/02/2018, 07:31 - Jess Edwards: I look like a little monkey with my big ears and mango munching
23/02/2018, 08:12 - Jess Edwards: Maw maw
23/02/2018, 08:12 - Jess Edwards: Gonna get porridge

23/02/2018, 09:23 - Tom Simpkins: Maw good
23/02/2018, 09:23 - Tom Simpkins: Five crumpets
23/02/2018, 09:23 - Tom Simpkins: Yum
23/02/2018, 11:10 - Tom Simpkins: Think Dave having issues, I wasn't online when this kicked off:
23/02/2018, 11:10 - Tom Simpkins: Alright lads, sorry about being a bit of a pain recently, honestly work has just got me really down at the moment, I'm being shafted by some horror jobs and just management being all around cunts, also Channon is working a lot of late shifts at the moment so I'm literally on my own the majority of the time afterwards, I've always been a bit of a radgie when it comes to gaming as Shaun can tell you from the glory days of CODMW2, but recently it's been getting worse due to the sheer fact that I'm just incredibly low at the moment, I really let losses get to me and I get super pessimist and angry, and I know that's a frankly horrid environment to be part of, deep down I want to just have fun with you lads but the super competitiveness I have isn't letting me do that, and the fact that winning games gives me that little boost I need to keep me going, whereas losing them knocks me a rung down, I know it's only a game, but right now it means more to me than I can possibly describe as it's the one thing that's keeping me going, it's the only thing that makes me feel successful while the rest of the time I've managed to convince myself I'm a failure, anywhere enough of this, I just wanted to say sorry, last thing I want is to introduce a toxic environment into something that's supposed to be fun, if anyone fancies it I might go on Helldivers for the next 30 or so
23/02/2018, 11:49 - Jess Edwards: Aw
23/02/2018, 11:49 - Jess Edwards: Poor poor Dave
23/02/2018, 11:49 - Jess Edwards: I feel awful for him
23/02/2018, 11:49 - Jess Edwards: Is he the lawyer??
23/02/2018, 11:49 - Jess Edwards: Say something nice to him
23/02/2018, 11:49 - Jess Edwards: Feel so much better about work
23/02/2018, 11:49 - Jess Edwards: I've put it in perspective
23/02/2018, 11:49 - Jess Edwards: It's an area to develop
23/02/2018, 11:50 - Jess Edwards: And I've smashed this morning
23/02/2018, 11:50 - Jess Edwards: And the pitch team love me so will get Ellie to send my TM feedback on me afterwards

21/03/2018, 15:51 - Tom Simpkins: I definitely wouldn't accept the change for now. If we reject the change, do we have more than 24 hours?
21/03/2018, 15:52 - Jess Edwards: Found one other option for the Singapore to London flight the same time as our original one, but it's £430 each whereas the original flight was about £280 each I reckon
21/03/2018, 15:52 - Jess Edwards: Fucking annoying!
21/03/2018, 15:54 - Jess Edwards: I reckon best bet money wise might be to accept it and find a new flight Ho chi to Singapore and try and get money back for old flight
21/03/2018, 15:55 - Tom Simpkins: Travel insurance yo
21/03/2018, 15:57 - Jess Edwards: Reckon would cover? Checked flights to Singapore and we'd have to arrive at like 1am, which would leave us with 8 hour wait!!! This is such faff! Will wait to sort until you get homey and then we can do it together
21/03/2018, 15:57 - Tom Simpkins: Mmmmhmmm
21/03/2018, 15:57 - Jess Edwards: What?!?
21/03/2018, 15:57 - Jess Edwards: I hear your tone!
21/03/2018, 15:57 - Tom Simpkins: Do you have travel insurance docs?
21/03/2018, 15:58 - Jess Edwards: No think you have them - would rather discuss when you homey!
21/03/2018, 15:58 - Tom Simpkins: Alrighty
21/03/2018, 15:59 - Jess Edwards: I hear alll your tone
21/03/2018, 15:59 - Tom Simpkins: ❤❤🙊🙊
21/03/2018, 16:00 - Jess Edwards: I'm writing down a list of our options so we can sort it quickly
21/03/2018, 16:01 - Tom Simpkins: Great, muchly appreciated
21/03/2018, 16:01 - Tom Simpkins: Thought you were going to halt progress to wait for me
21/03/2018, 16:01 - Tom Simpkins: Hence tone
21/03/2018, 16:01 - Tom Simpkins: Unhelpful tone cheerfully recinded
21/03/2018, 16:05 - Tom Simpkins: Got email from HR saying that the bonus I got in ski was early part of full bonus
21/03/2018, 16:08 - Jess Edwards: Rightfully so it is rescinded!
21/03/2018, 16:08 - Jess Edwards: I have made progress
21/03/2018, 16:09 - Jess Edwards: I think best option is to either accept change and make holiday one day shorter, taking approx a £50 hit each and 7 hours in Singapore airport OR pick the replacement flight offered and make our holiday one day longer, with same cost and airport implications as option 1
21/03/2018, 16:09 - Jess Edwards: We can discuss laters!
21/03/2018, 16:23 - Jess Edwards: X
21/03/2018, 17:00 - Tom Simpkins: If this is pushing the price upwards, we may want to relook at direct flights
21/03/2018, 17:30 - Tom Simpkins: Wanna get a joint bank account?
21/03/2018, 17:44 - Jess Edwards: That's a good point - from Ho Chi Minh
21/03/2018, 17:44 - Jess Edwards: I'm going to the shops to get veggie tart ingreds now but then will look at cost of direct flights
21/03/2018, 17:45 - Jess Edwards: Though just phoned kiwi.com to ask how much of a refund we'd get and they said they couldn't confirm whether we'd get a 'full or partial refund'! Outrageous
21/03/2018, 17:54 - Tom Simpkins: Absolute bollocks
21/03/2018, 17:54 - Tom Simpkins: Well
21/03/2018, 17:55 - Tom Simpkins: Travel insurance will cover I think
21/03/2018, 17:55 - Tom Simpkins: Which is why we bought travel insurance so early
21/03/2018, 17:59 - Jess Edwards: Indeedio
21/03/2018, 18:00 - Jess Edwards: We can analyse options and progress when you homey
21/03/2018, 18:00 - Jess Edwards: Jane arriving with builder soonsie
21/03/2018, 18:00 - Jess Edwards: I'm making yummy tart that you can consume for dins
21/03/2018, 18:27 - Jess Edwards: Pesto red onion cheese and pepper
21/03/2018, 18:28 - Jess Edwards: Waiting for Jane
21/03/2018, 18:32 - Jess Edwards: She's here
21/03/2018, 18:32 - Jess Edwards: Younger than I expected!!
21/03/2018, 18:32 - Jess Edwards: Reckon there's quite an age gap between her and hub hub
21/03/2018, 18:35 - Jess Edwards: I'm eavesdropping
21/03/2018, 18:36 - Jess Edwards: She wants a wooden laminate surface to replace kitchen surface
21/03/2018, 18:36 - Jess Edwards: And is planning to unbox the boiler
21/03/2018, 19:10 - Jess Edwards: Claire was VERY sympathetic
21/03/2018, 19:12 - Jess Edwards: She isn't sure whether insurance will cover airline change
21/03/2018, 19:24 - Jess Edwards: Ok I worked out we're entitled to a full Singapore-London refund
21/03/2018, 19:24 - Jess Edwards: Which is 231 each
21/03/2018, 19:24 - Jess Edwards: It's questionable whether we get 70 quid each for the scoot flight
21/03/2018, 19:30 - Tom Simpkins: Hmm two options are:
Refund flight, bin scoot and get direct at a cost of £170 each
Keep new flight, no money cost, seven hours in Singapore
21/03/2018, 19:31 - Tom Simpkins: Get two new flights, at a presumed cost of £70 (binning the scoot)
21/03/2018, 19:32 - Jess Edwards: Will wait to discuss when you home my one
21/03/2018, 19:32 - Jess Edwards: Also I think I'm going to email Jane my thoughts on the bath tomorrow
21/03/2018, 19:33 - Jess Edwards: Option one will cost more like 230 pounds more each
21/03/2018, 19:34 - Tom Simpkins: Kkkkk understood
21/03/2018, 19:34 - Tom Simpkins: Lots of dollar

22/03/2018, 09:44 - Jess Edwards: So unsure what to do with the private healthcare
22/03/2018, 09:45 - Tom Simpkins: I would read the t and C's and see whether you can deduce if you're covered / whether any appointments can be covered afterwards
22/03/2018, 09:47 - Jess Edwards: Indeed

22/03/2018, 16:34 - Jess Edwards: Unsure what to do with private healthcare
22/03/2018, 16:34 - Jess Edwards: Reckon it will take about a week to activate
22/03/2018, 16:35 - Jess Edwards: And hr says it won't cover pre existing conditions
22/03/2018, 16:35 - Jess Edwards: So don't know whether best to wait before I go to urologist
22/03/2018, 16:44 - Tom Simpkins: If it doesn't cover pre existing
22/03/2018, 16:44 - Tom Simpkins: Just carry on with appointment
22/03/2018, 17:05 - Jess Edwards: Waiting for it to be activated before I go, so cancelling tomorrow's appt
22/03/2018, 17:06 - Jess Edwards: But doctor is phoning me so I can get a repeated antibiotic prescription tomozzle
22/03/2018, 17:16 - Tom Simpkins: But you've just been told it's not valid on existing conditions?
22/03/2018, 17:28 - Jess Edwards: But it might be covered...
22/03/2018, 17:28 - Jess Edwards: What do you think?
22/03/2018, 17:28 - Jess Edwards: It hasn't been diagnosed
22/03/2018, 17:28 - Tom Simpkins: It's your call
22/03/2018, 17:29 - Tom Simpkins: Given a week for it to get set up, worst case is you end up paying for the London bridge appointment you already have but ten days later
22/03/2018, 17:45 - Jess Edwards: Also a rule that you can't claim during first 2 weeks of the policy being active
22/03/2018, 17:47 - Tom Simpkins: Ah

22/03/2018, 18:01 - Tom Simpkins: Waiting for three weeks is really long
22/03/2018, 18:02 - Tom Simpkins: I've got to defeat the final boss on ratchet and clank
22/03/2018, 18:08 - Jess Edwards: I agreeee

11/06/2018, 20:51 - Tom Simpkins: Hi Tom, so I was feeling better until I started uncontrollably shaking this afternoon. The lack of control was honestly quite terrifying. Anyway the lady I called on 111 said it's probably a side effect of the vaccine that the doctor decided to give me yesterday. She also said it would be very strange to get hit by side effects after 24 hours. So I might actually be fine tomorrow! Once again, I'll let you know before 0930 tomorrow morning.
11/06/2018, 20:55 - Jess Edwards: Ahahaahahahhahaha
11/06/2018, 20:55 - Jess Edwards: Claire and I are dying

19/06/2018, 18:52 - Tom Simpkins: Hi Tom. I've got nowhere with the package shrinking thing. I don't think I can do anything so I would like to move on to something that I can actually do. One thing that needs sorting out is the storybook. I could ask Alex D about helping with that tomorrow if you're ok with it. I would like to do it because I've only really scratched the surface of react type things and it would be nice to delve a bit deeper into react. However I will of course do whatever you want first before I try and start something new! Hopefully I will be less ill and therefore less grumpy tomorrow!

15/08/2018, 16:39 - Tom Simpkins: Woo yoga
15/08/2018, 17:12 - Jess Edwards: My annual review went SO well
15/08/2018, 17:12 - Jess Edwards: I'll take photo of feedback
15/08/2018, 17:12 - Jess Edwards: Though I asked about salary review at the end and apparently if you do 'great' (which I think I did) you should expect a rise of around 5%. Which I wouldn't be happy with because it would only take me to 35 when the middle of my band is more like 37. But as it was such a positive meeting I decided to leave it there, wait for the official offer in writing when I get back and then I can challenge. Did I do good?
15/08/2018, 17:36 - Tom Simpkins: 5% is weak imo
15/08/2018, 17:36 - Tom Simpkins: But you did good I think
15/08/2018, 17:37 - Tom Simpkins: How did it phrase your I'll come back to it?
15/08/2018, 18:34 - Jess Edwards: That's what I thought! Nancy said it was much higher yesterday
15/08/2018, 18:34 - Jess Edwards: Between 7 and 15
15/08/2018, 18:34 - Jess Edwards: I'm going to negotiate it
15/08/2018, 18:35 - Jess Edwards: Totally agree
15/08/2018, 18:35 - Jess Edwards: They wouldn't be paying me fairly
15/08/2018, 18:35 - Jess Edwards: And I have stellar written feedback now that I can reference
15/08/2018, 18:35 - Jess Edwards: I'm still here!! Gonna be for another hour I reckon :(
15/08/2018, 18:36 - Jess Edwards: Shall we cheeky pizza?

18/08/2018, 06:11 - Jess Edwards: Katelyn's parents are adorable
18/08/2018, 06:12 - Jess Edwards: Her sister is really quite odd/annoying
18/08/2018, 06:12 - Jess Edwards: Quite socially weird
18/08/2018, 08:28 - Tom Simpkins: Sounds like a plan
18/08/2018, 08:28 - Tom Simpkins: I'm aiming for the welcome my l exhibition near Euston as my culture
18/08/2018, 08:28 - Tom Simpkins: Currently on way to Un1t
18/08/2018, 08:29 - Tom Simpkins: Meeting Tim for sesh
18/08/2018, 08:30 - Tom Simpkins: I reckon I'll be home before you're awake
18/08/2018, 08:30 - Tom Simpkins: So all good with you calling
18/08/2018, 08:31 - Tom Simpkins: Rob messaged asking if I wanted to do a Bristol cycling weekend
18/08/2018, 08:31 - Tom Simpkins: Might do that next weekend
18/08/2018, 08:31 - Tom Simpkins: When are you back again?
18/08/2018, 13:10 - Tom Simpkins: <Media omitted>
18/08/2018, 13:10 - Tom Simpkins: Lol
18/08/2018, 13:11 - Tom Simpkins: Coming back from the Wellcome exhibition
18/08/2018, 13:11 - Tom Simpkins: Two Ls in Wellcome is intensh
18/08/2018, 13:11 - Tom Simpkins: Was so good
18/08/2018, 13:15 - Tom Simpkins: There were exhibits on bull insemination influenced by genetic testing, hiv drugs and their effectiveness, free diving, the history of teeth and dentistry, some miscellaneous human body stuff and then the collections of the original founder, Mr Wellcome
18/08/2018, 13:15 - Tom Simpkins: Teeth was my favourite
18/08/2018, 13:15 - Tom Simpkins: Dentistry really began in Paris in the 18 century
18/08/2018, 13:16 - Tom Simpkins: There were "teeth pullers" who would remove rotten teeth and would be really theatrical / it would be a performance in front of an audience
18/08/2018, 13:16 - Tom Simpkins: But often free, because they sell tickets
18/08/2018, 13:17 - Tom Simpkins: And if you were more well off you would go to the "Barber surgeon" lol
18/08/2018, 13:17 - Tom Simpkins: But no real provision for teeth health apart from removing teeth
18/08/2018, 13:18 - Tom Simpkins: Then one of the teeth pullers rebranded to an upmarket version, aiming at rich people
18/08/2018, 13:19 - Tom Simpkins: Got fancy tools and started looking at means to avoid extractions
18/08/2018, 13:19 - Tom Simpkins: And also looked at replacing teeth, which wasn't really a thing
18/08/2018, 13:20 - Tom Simpkins: He branded himself as a "dentiste" and criticised the tooth pullers
18/08/2018, 13:21 - Tom Simpkins: With teeth replacement the teeth were initially ivory, and then a fad for human teeth
18/08/2018, 13:21 - Tom Simpkins: When human teeth started being used, they obviously grew in value
18/08/2018, 13:22 - Tom Simpkins: So there were adverts for people who were happy to lose teeth for money
18/08/2018, 13:22 - Tom Simpkins: And paintings of people plucking teeth from hanged corpses
18/08/2018, 13:24 - Tom Simpkins: In the battle of Waterloo 50000 people were killed, and in 24 hours all the teeth were harvested
18/08/2018, 13:24 - Tom Simpkins: Looked like a dubious source for that titbit though
18/08/2018, 13:24 - Tom Simpkins: Also sidenote, did you know the last guillotine execution in France was in 1977?!?
18/08/2018, 13:24 - Tom Simpkins: Wth right!
18/08/2018, 13:26 - Tom Simpkins: George Washington always looks tight lipped in pictures, but the reason is most likely because he's working to hold down the spring on his dentures
18/08/2018, 13:26 - Tom Simpkins: Anaesthetic methods only kicked in around 1905 in the UK, and they were cocaine based lmao
18/08/2018, 13:28 - Tom Simpkins: Looked at all the dental implements too. There were foot powered dental drills which could maintain 3000rpm "if the dentist was fit" lol
18/08/2018, 13:28 - Tom Simpkins: Current electric dentist drills do 500000rpm!
18/08/2018, 13:29 - Tom Simpkins: You never see anyone smile with teeth in old portraits because showing teeth was considered rude or vulgar because they usually smelt/were rotting
18/08/2018, 13:30 - Tom Simpkins: Queen victoria is a good example of one of the first to bare their teeth in portrait
18/08/2018, 13:30 - Tom Simpkins: Cool there's my brain dump from teeth
18/08/2018, 13:30 - Tom Simpkins: Feel free to ask about any of the other above topics
18/08/2018, 13:31 - Tom Simpkins: Oh wait no there's one more, when the NHS was first introduced, the amount of dentistry work was way underestimated
18/08/2018, 13:31 - Tom Simpkins: Because it was now free
18/08/2018, 13:31 - Tom Simpkins: Hence the introduction of dental charges on nhs
18/08/2018, 16:10 - Jess Edwards: Hello my snookel! I am awake!!! What a fantastic summary of that exhibition! I read it out to twiggy in bed and we both found it very interesting
18/08/2018, 16:10 - Jess Edwards: Can't believe the guillotine date!!
18/08/2018, 16:10 - Jess Edwards: Wtf
18/08/2018, 16:10 - Jess Edwards: I am glad we have modern dentistry
18/08/2018, 16:10 - Jess Edwards: Pie would not have done well with the springs
18/08/2018, 16:10 - Jess Edwards: I shall phone in the next hour or so!

18/08/2018, 23:21 - Jess Edwards: Off to the rodeo!
19/08/2018, 06:56 - Jess Edwards: Back from the rodeo!
19/08/2018, 06:56 - Jess Edwards: It was the most surreal thing I have ever attended
19/08/2018, 06:56 - Jess Edwards: <Media omitted>
19/08/2018, 06:58 - Jess Edwards: <Media omitted>
19/08/2018, 06:58 - Jess Edwards: That is a child riding a sheep
19/08/2018, 06:58 - Jess Edwards: <Media omitted>
19/08/2018, 06:59 - Jess Edwards: Can't wait to tell you about it
19/08/2018, 09:28 - Tom Simpkins: Looks really patriotic
19/08/2018, 09:28 - Tom Simpkins: I reckon I would be good at sheep riding
19/08/2018, 09:28 - Tom Simpkins: Was it cruel?
19/08/2018, 09:29 - Tom Simpkins: I'm on ma way to Un1t
19/08/2018, 09:29 - Tom Simpkins: Then going to do the London Docklands museum
19/08/2018, 14:34 - Tom Simpkins: Just finished at the docklands museum
19/08/2018, 14:34 - Tom Simpkins: I didn't find it as interesting as the wellcome exhibition
19/08/2018, 14:34 - Tom Simpkins: But still some good knowledge
19/08/2018, 14:35 - Tom Simpkins: Talked about the foundation of the docklands / London Thames trade
19/08/2018, 14:36 - Tom Simpkins: Loads of dates about warehouses and stuff at the start
19/08/2018, 14:36 - Tom Simpkins: Boring
19/08/2018, 14:36 - Tom Simpkins: But got interesting when started discussing the global trade
19/08/2018, 14:37 - Tom Simpkins: The East India trading company pretty much ran India
19/08/2018, 14:38 - Tom Simpkins: I knew the British empire had colonised India but I didn't realise it was so commercially, obviously with violence, but not a war
19/08/2018, 14:39 - Tom Simpkins: The most interesting part was to do with the role of the docks in sugar trading and slavery
19/08/2018, 14:39 - Tom Simpkins: Huge boom in sugar trade drove such growth and wealth among the elite
19/08/2018, 14:40 - Tom Simpkins: And obviously the slave trade alongside that because it was the fastest way to get labor to plantations
19/08/2018, 14:41 - Tom Simpkins: the paintings of these plantations hide a lot of the crueller detail
19/08/2018, 14:42 - Tom Simpkins: Few show whips / beatings
19/08/2018, 14:43 - Tom Simpkins: There was a calculation someone had done describing the cost of a slave having a baby
19/08/2018, 14:43 - Tom Simpkins: Really effect at showing how much people were thought of as commodities
19/08/2018, 14:44 - Tom Simpkins: Things like "lost output of mother"
19/08/2018, 14:44 - Tom Simpkins: "cost of child while not productive"
19/08/2018, 14:47 - Tom Simpkins: London, Liverpool and a couple of Brazilian ports were the largest slave ports in the world by number of spaces passing through
19/08/2018, 14:48 - Tom Simpkins: Then when abolition of slavery in 1830s (after 50+ years of campaigning)
19/08/2018, 14:49 - Tom Simpkins: It's thought this made it through parliament because firms realised that slave labor was less efficient than free labor
19/08/2018, 14:50 - Tom Simpkins: And all slave owners were compensated for "loss of property"
19/08/2018, 14:51 - Tom Simpkins: And slaves had to work an "apprenticeship" for six years after this! Paid minimally, with little change to conditions. Sounded like forced labour over slavery
19/08/2018, 14:52 - Tom Simpkins: So because the majority of slaves were African, the plantations brought in loads of workers from other areas e.g. China and India
19/08/2018, 14:54 - Tom Simpkins: The political movement for abolition of slavery was relatively modern, with propaganda and speeches. Women played a large part in the push, unusual at the time because they were pushed towards political inactivity.
19/08/2018, 14:55 - Tom Simpkins: It sounds like London got more racist after abolishment
19/08/2018, 14:57 - Tom Simpkins: One quote was "a third of people openly say foreigners are better suited to picking sugar / bananas, a third don't care so long as arsenal win and the rest are nice people"
19/08/2018, 15:12 - Tom Simpkins: Then the part on Docklands during the way was interesting
19/08/2018, 15:12 - Tom Simpkins: Talked about how supplies were moved around
19/08/2018, 15:13 - Tom Simpkins: The West of Scotland became a big trade port
19/08/2018, 15:13 - Tom Simpkins: Loads of bombing on Thames docks
19/08/2018, 15:13 - Tom Simpkins: Some good innovations too.
19/08/2018, 15:14 - Tom Simpkins: So the Germans dropped magnetic mines in Thames
19/08/2018, 15:14 - Tom Simpkins: These had a magnetic pin inside that triggers when something large and metal passed over
19/08/2018, 15:14 - Tom Simpkins: Deterrents were blimps that attempted to block the flight path
19/08/2018, 15:36 - Tom Simpkins: And there were lots of appointed watchers to plot where the mines landed
19/08/2018, 15:36 - Tom Simpkins: And navy sweepers that would go explode the mines
19/08/2018, 15:38 - Tom Simpkins: But then scientists discovered how to "degauss" the ships, reversing the direction of the magnetic force so that ships could pass over freely
19/08/2018, 15:39 - Tom Simpkins: Then a load of d day prep happened at Thames of course
19/08/2018, 15:39 - Tom Simpkins: Like building a ship that could lay down a fuel line to France!
19/08/2018, 15:40 - Tom Simpkins: And the sea going bridges that could be used to disembark ships from up to a mile out to cost
19/08/2018, 15:40 - Tom Simpkins: Coast
19/08/2018, 15:40 - Tom Simpkins: But the builders weren't told what they were building because it was secret
19/08/2018, 15:43 - Tom Simpkins: And finally when Germany was launching v1 and V2 rockets in to London, aiming at central including Docklands, spies leaked info with false hit coordinates
19/08/2018, 15:44 - Tom Simpkins: So that the Germans adjusted their aim wrongly
19/08/2018, 15:44 - Tom Simpkins: Essentially saving one part of London for another!
19/08/2018, 15:44 - Tom Simpkins: Phew
19/08/2018, 15:44 - Tom Simpkins: Brain dump done
19/08/2018, 15:46 - Jess Edwards: Maw maw! I am wakeful! Thank you for the brain dump my snookel!

19/08/2018, 15:47 - Jess Edwards: Where are the docklands?/the museum
19/08/2018, 15:47 - Tom Simpkins: It was!
19/08/2018, 15:47 - Tom Simpkins: Canary wharf area
19/08/2018, 15:47 - Jess Edwards: The slave trade measurements are harrowing
19/08/2018, 15:47 - Jess Edwards: 'Lost output'
19/08/2018, 15:47 - Jess Edwards: And the magnetic ship mines
19/08/2018, 15:47 - Jess Edwards: I wanna go!
19/08/2018, 15:47 - Jess Edwards: Earliest I've woken up so far!
19/08/2018, 15:47 - Tom Simpkins: You're welcome to
19/08/2018, 15:48 - Jess Edwards: Large parts of the rodeo were cruel
19/08/2018, 15:48 - Tom Simpkins: Ah
19/08/2018, 15:48 - Tom Simpkins: Sad
19/08/2018, 15:48 - Jess Edwards: And a few bits weren't
19/08/2018, 15:48 - Jess Edwards: I would say 65% cruel
19/08/2018, 15:49 - Tom Simpkins: <Media omitted>
19/08/2018, 15:49 - Tom Simpkins: For Jamie
19/08/2018, 15:49 - Jess Edwards: There was one horrible one where calves were let our running ahead of the horse, and the cowboy had to lasso the calf round the neck
19/08/2018, 15:49 - Tom Simpkins: Yeah I guessed that would happen
19/08/2018, 15:49 - Jess Edwards: And then wrestle it to the ground and tie it up
19/08/2018, 15:49 - Jess Edwards: And then the horse was trained to pull it backwards
19/08/2018, 15:49 - Jess Edwards: It was grotesque but impressive
19/08/2018, 15:50 - Tom Simpkins: Lol
19/08/2018, 15:50 - Jess Edwards: The cowboy culture is just ridiculous
19/08/2018, 15:50 - Tom Simpkins: Like eating 2.7kg of bakes beans
19/08/2018, 15:50 - Jess Edwards: I have never seen anything like it
19/08/2018, 15:50 - Jess Edwards: So hard to explain
19/08/2018, 15:50 - Jess Edwards: It was like going back in time
19/08/2018, 15:50 - Jess Edwards: So sexist
19/08/2018, 15:50 - Tom Simpkins: Yeah
19/08/2018, 15:51 - Tom Simpkins: I would have guessed that too
19/08/2018, 15:51 - Jess Edwards: There was a bit of the stands called 'the chick pit' where the wives sat
19/08/2018, 15:51 - Jess Edwards: It's unusual to be over 22 and not married here
19/08/2018, 15:51 - Tom Simpkins: Wow
19/08/2018, 15:51 - Tom Simpkins: Crazy
19/08/2018, 15:51 - Jess Edwards: <Media omitted>
19/08/2018, 15:51 - Jess Edwards: It's on the right of the white gates
19/08/2018, 15:52 - Jess Edwards: I've honestly never been anywhere so isolated/anachronistic
19/08/2018, 15:52 - Tom Simpkins: Anachronistic?
19/08/2018, 15:52 - Jess Edwards: Felt like going back in time
19/08/2018, 15:52 - Jess Edwards: Is what it means
19/08/2018, 15:52 - Tom Simpkins: Ah
19/08/2018, 15:52 - Jess Edwards: Like weirdly at odds with modern society
19/08/2018, 15:52 - Tom Simpkins: Posho

31/08/2018, 07:55 - Jess Edwards: Such maths my snookel! I shall write you a rhyme to go with it:
31/08/2018, 07:55 - Jess Edwards: There were twelve balls,
And eleven were equals.
Yet one was wrong,
It sung its own song.
Along came a man,
Armed with a plan.
While his pie pie slept,
And later into bed he crept,
After solving the crime,
It certainly took enough time!
31/08/2018, 08:10 - Jess Edwards: How about dinner somewhere quick at 6.15 somewhere near the pier if we're done with  work?

Apparently her ticket was torn and the bouncer didn't want to let her back in.
21/09/2018, 08:02 - Tom Simpkins: Then
21/09/2018, 08:03 - Tom Simpkins: Along comes Jonathon from queer eye

21/09/2018, 11:36 - Jess Edwards: Didn't let me present any part of meeting
21/09/2018, 11:36 - Jess Edwards: Which would have been good for me
21/09/2018, 11:36 - Jess Edwards: And doing things like reminding me to clear up after myself (!) and told me not to reference McDonald's strikes in public which I only did in a way that no one listening to us would realise what we're talking about
21/09/2018, 11:37 - Jess Edwards: argh
21/09/2018, 11:41 - Tom Simpkins: She's such a bell end

21/09/2018, 16:21 - Jess Edwards: She is just niggling at me over such stupid things that aren't my fault
21/09/2018, 16:21 - Jess Edwards: For example, I sent an email earlier and a client sent an arsey reply. I checked with an SC (yani) who said to leave it and not reply because she was being unreasonable
21/09/2018, 16:21 - Jess Edwards: And then she told me 'if it were her she would have replied'
21/09/2018, 16:22 - Jess Edwards: And it felt so petty but it was so unfair being told two conflicting instructions

24/09/2018, 09:44 - Tom Simpkins: This book is so interesting
24/09/2018, 09:44 - Tom Simpkins: It just explained why jet lag is worse going east than West
24/09/2018, 09:44 - Tom Simpkins: There's two reasons
24/09/2018, 09:45 - Tom Simpkins: Eastwards requires you to fall asleep earlier which is much harder than staying awake longer
24/09/2018, 09:45 - Tom Simpkins: And
24/09/2018, 09:45 - Tom Simpkins: The circadian rhythm is actually slightly longer than 24 hours
24/09/2018, 09:46 - Tom Simpkins: So stretching a day naturally easier than contacting a day
24/09/2018, 09:33 - Jess Edwards: O

24/09/2018, 10:06 - Jess Edwards: A few interesting work titbits from the pie
24/09/2018, 10:06 - Jess Edwards: One - Anth got stood up at the weekend
24/09/2018, 10:06 - Jess Edwards: Two - I'm checking Alisa's diary to see whether she is OK to meet this morning and she's got a meeting with the founder of another agency at lunch!
24/09/2018, 10:07 - Jess Edwards: And hasn't made the invite private
24/09/2018, 10:07 - Jess Edwards: Lol

24/09/2018, 11:22 - Jess Edwards: Did my scary salary conversation with Alisa
24/09/2018, 11:22 - Jess Edwards: Said I ideally want 38
24/09/2018, 11:23 - Jess Edwards: And she said that's really fair but the business will come back and offer me 34.5/35 as part of the routine salary review. She said the other option is to do a renegotiation, where she proactively goes to the head of salaries and makes my case - and I said I want that one please
24/09/2018, 11:23 - Jess Edwards: And she said she will
24/09/2018, 11:24 - Jess Edwards: So I'm hopeful!

24/09/2018, 11:53 - Tom Simpkins: And he's put a link in the wording
24/09/2018, 11:53 - Tom Simpkins: On how to enable flash
24/09/2018, 11:53 - Tom Simpkins: A) external link we have no control over equals security risk
24/09/2018, 11:54 - Tom Simpkins: B) the opening line describes flash as a security vulnerability!
24/09/2018, 11:54 - Tom Simpkins: My assumption is he's been sharing this link with clients
24/09/2018, 11:54 - Tom Simpkins: Argh

26/09/2018, 11:02 - Tom Simpkins: I'm dyslexic so I was hoping that auto correct on my phone would help me with spelling
26/09/2018, 11:03 - Tom Simpkins: It didn't always work though. For example I asked my friend if he wanted to go for a wank by the river!
26/09/2018, 11:03 - Tom Simpkins: I mean come on. Canal, I meant canal!
26/09/2018, 11:06 - Tom Simpkins: When I see letters on a page, the letters scramble and change position, like bs and hs because they look the same so I'm dyslexic. My friend has the same thing with numbers, so he sees 12 for 21 for example. So that makes him..... A pedophile

10/10/2018, 11:32 - Tom Simpkins: Cracking on
10/10/2018, 11:44 - Jess Edwards: Got an update on salary negotiation outcome - which is final apparently. So Alisa talked to director in charge of salaries who said I was originally in the pot for a 5% raise as part of my annual review. She said that I'd performed really well and had requested 37 and a renegotiation. The director said they only do renegotiations at promotion time and the max raise they give to consultants is 7%. Apparently Alisa said that she'd like them to consider more. So they've agreed to give me a 9% annual review raise which brings me to 36. I am not fully satisfied but think I'll leave it there for now as its a good outcome for first time I've pushed on them for more money. What do you think?
10/10/2018, 11:53 - Tom Simpkins: I'd stick by the sounds of it
10/10/2018, 11:53 - Tom Simpkins: Well done!!!!!
10/10/2018, 11:54 - Tom Simpkins: You've nearly doubled your raise

10/10/2018, 12:01 - Jess Edwards: And Alisa was hinting that she thinks I'll be senior consultant by this time next year which would be great and a big opp to negotiate big raise
10/10/2018, 12:01 - Jess Edwards: Yay!
10/10/2018, 12:27 - Tom Simpkins: Awesome sauce

Over the summer I have been doing some research into industry salaries and benchmarking, and would like to ask the business whether it would consider raising mine to XXX a year. Hopefully you'll agree my feedback reflects my value to the firm, and I want to be compensated in a way that enables me to build a long term career here. Would you be able to progress this request for me through the right channels over the next few weeks? Do let me know if you need me to join any meetings or put this in writing for you.
11/10/2018, 08:53 - Jess Edwards: It's scary but will be ok!
